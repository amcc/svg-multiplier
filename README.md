**How to find the variants**

There's multiple branches each with a variant in this repo. I'm using Gatsby for my react base. Why? Well I like Gatsby, it gets the project going with everything you need in react / CSS modules / pages etc.

Want your own do this

```shell
# create a new Gatsby site using the minimal starter
npm init gatsby
```

otherwise clone the repo and have a play
